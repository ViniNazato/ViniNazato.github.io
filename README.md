### About Me
My journey into the world of data science started at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I received my Business Degree. It all began when I started experimenting with basic applications for constructing pipelines/procedures, like Excel's VBA, and I discovered just how powerful programming can be. Since then, I have come a long way, learning about data analysis and machine learning (and its fundamental foundation in statistics and linear algebra, which is often neglected), and started to make some projects of my own, often, but not limited, in the field of econometrics. Here, you will be able to check out some of these projects!

## Data Science Projects

### [1. Linear Regression Study on Wage Analysis](https://github.com/ViniNazato/LinearRegression)

In this repository you will find a comprehensive introduction to Linear Regression with Python, where i will focus on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression, **the** essential machine learning model. While not mandatory, having a basic understanding of statistics would be beneficial for grasping the concepts discussed.Linear regression is a widely-used statistical technique that establishes a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. OLS regression, in particular, minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. Understanding linear regression is crucial for constructing more advanced models and analyzing real-world problems in various domains, such as marketing, finance, healthcare, and social sciences.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that presents a step-by-step guide to creating and interpreting a linear regression model using Python and the statsmodels library.

### [2. Deep Learning Classification Pytorch - MNIST](https://github.com/ViniNazato/DeepLearningMNIST)
This repository contains a simple Python implementation using PyTorch for the classification of the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), widely used for training various image processing systems. It aims to demonstrate a basic image classification pipeline using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The model is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) designed to classify handwritten digits.

### [3. Cointegration Analysis for Pair Trading](https://github.com/ViniNazato/Cointegration-PairTrading)

This repository contains code and resources related to Cointegration Pair Trading. The purpose of this project is to explore and implement pair trading strategies based on cointegration analysis. Pair trading is a popular trading strategy that involves taking positions in two correlated securities to take advantage of relative price movements. Cointegration analysis helps identify pairs of assets that move together over time, making them suitable candidates for pair trading strategies. This repository provides code and tools for implementing cointegration-based pair trading strategies. It includes scripts for data analysis, strategy development, and backtesting.

### [4. Predicting Industrial Production](https://github.com/ViniNazato/PredictingIndustrialProduction)

This project is dedicated to the forecast analysis of the OECD Industrial Production using two distinct models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) based on the Box & Jenkins Methodology, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. The primary objective is to compare the performance of these models in forecasting industrial production and provide insights into their accuracy. After extensive analysis and evaluation, the results indicate that the MLP Neural Network outperformed the ARIMA model in terms of forecasting accuracy. However, it's noteworthy that both models exhibit the same statistical accuracy, according to the Diebold-Mariano test.
