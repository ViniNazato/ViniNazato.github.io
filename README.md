## Overview
Hello! My name is Vinícius Nazato, a passionate data scientist with a curiosity for solving complex problems using data-driven approaches. 
### About Me
My journey into the world of data science started at University of São Paulo, where i received my Business Degree. It all started when i started to mess with basic applications for constructing pipelines/procedures, like Excel's VBA and i discovered just how powerfull programing can be. Since then i came a long way learning about machine learning (and it's fundamental foundation in statistics and linear algebra that is often neglected) and started to male osme projects of my own. Here you will be able to check out some of these projects.
