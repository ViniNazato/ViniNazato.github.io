### About Me
I am a dedicated Financial Data Scientist with a robust foundation in statistics and econometrics. My expertise lies in leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex financial problems and drive strategic decision-making. Proficient in statistical modeling, predictive analytics, and economic theory, I excel at interpreting large datasets and transforming them into actionable intelligence using tools like Python, R, and SQL. I am continually driven by the dynamic nature of the financial world and the possibilities that data science offers to innovate and improve financial strategies. An effective communicator, I translate complex statistical findings into clear insights for stakeholders. Outside of work, I stay current with the latest research in finance and data science.

My journey into financial data science began at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, where I earned my Business degree and where I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Quantitative Finance. It all started with experimenting with basic tools like Excel's VBA to construct pipelines and procedures. This experience revealed to me the immense power of programming. Since then, I have delved deeply into data analysis and machine learning, discovering the crucial importance of their foundations in statistics and linear algebra, which are often overlooked. Here, you will be able to check out some of these projects!

## Data Science Projects

### [1. Linear Regression Study on Wage Analysis](https://github.com/ViniNazato/LinearRegression)

In this repository you will find a comprehensive introduction to Linear Regression with Python, where i will focus on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression, **the** essential machine learning model. While not mandatory, having a basic understanding of statistics would be beneficial for grasping the concepts discussed.Linear regression is a widely-used statistical technique that establishes a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. OLS regression, in particular, minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. Understanding linear regression is crucial for constructing more advanced models and analyzing real-world problems in various domains, such as marketing, finance, healthcare, and social sciences.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that presents a step-by-step guide to creating and interpreting a linear regression model using Python and the statsmodels library.

### [2. Deep Learning Classification Pytorch - MNIST](https://github.com/ViniNazato/DeepLearningMNIST)
This repository contains a simple Python implementation using PyTorch for the classification of the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), widely used for training various image processing systems. It aims to demonstrate a basic image classification pipeline using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The model is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) designed to classify handwritten digits.

### [3. Cointegration Analysis for Pair Trading](https://github.com/ViniNazato/Cointegration-PairTrading)

This repository contains code and resources related to Cointegration Pair Trading. The purpose of this project is to explore and implement pair trading strategies based on cointegration analysis. Pair trading is a popular trading strategy that involves taking positions in two correlated securities to take advantage of relative price movements. Cointegration analysis helps identify pairs of assets that move together over time, making them suitable candidates for pair trading strategies. This repository provides code and tools for implementing cointegration-based pair trading strategies. It includes scripts for data analysis, strategy development, and backtesting.

### [4. Predicting Industrial Production](https://github.com/ViniNazato/PredictingIndustrialProduction)

This project is dedicated to the forecast analysis of the OECD Industrial Production using two distinct models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) based on the Box & Jenkins Methodology, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. The primary objective is to compare the performance of these models in forecasting industrial production and provide insights into their accuracy. After extensive analysis and evaluation, the results indicate that the MLP Neural Network outperformed the ARIMA model in terms of forecasting accuracy. However, it's noteworthy that both models exhibit the same statistical accuracy, according to the Diebold-Mariano test.

## Repository for Financial Econometrics Lessons (currently in progress) (https://github.com/ViniNazato/FinancialEconometrics)
This repository contains materials related to Financial Econometrics and Risk Management. It will cover various important topics for understanding and modeling financial series in different contexts. More than anything, these materials are designed to reinforce the content. It is advisable to follow along with a base textbook (In Portuguese Brazil).

### [1. Market Risk Modelling](https://github.com/ViniNazato/FinancialEconometrics/tree/main/Risk%20Modelling)
This folder contains materials on financial risk management, including notebooks on Properties of Returns, Conditional Volatility, Value at Risk, and Extreme Value Theory.
