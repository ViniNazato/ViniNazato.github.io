## Overview
Hello! My name is **Vinícius Nazato**, a passionate data scientist with a curiosity for solving complex problems using data-driven approaches. 
### About Me
My journey into the world of data science started at the University of São Paulo, where I received my Business Degree. It all began when I started experimenting with basic applications for constructing pipelines/procedures, like Excel's VBA, and I discovered just how powerful programming can be. Since then, I have come a long way, learning about data analysis and machine learning (and its fundamental foundation in statistics and linear algebra, which is often neglected), and started to make some projects of my own, often, but not limited, in the field of econometrics. Here, you will be able to check out some of these projects!

## Projects
### [1. Linear Regression Study on Wage Analysis](https://github.com/ViniNazato/LinearRegression)

In this repository you will find a comprehensive introduction to Linear Regression with Python, where i will focus on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression, **the** essential machine learning model. While not mandatory, having a basic understanding of statistics would be beneficial for grasping the concepts discussed.Linear regression is a widely-used statistical technique that establishes a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. OLS regression, in particular, minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. Understanding linear regression is crucial for constructing more advanced models and analyzing real-world problems in various domains, such as marketing, finance, healthcare, and social sciences.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that presents a step-by-step guide to creating and interpreting a linear regression model using Python and the statsmodels library.
